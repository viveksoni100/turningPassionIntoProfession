Why PalmVein is far better biometric input? And how developers can build an application that works with PalmVein scanners?

How palm-scanning identification works :
The scanner emits infrared light. Hemoglobin in the veins absorbs the light...creating an image of the vein pattern that is reflected back and captured by the scanner.
-takes snapshot of palm veins
-converts into algorithm
-compares with database

The scan is stored in a database. A returning user's vein pattern is compared against the database to determine if there is a match.

What are the benefits :
the veins are located beneath the skin’s surface and, furthermore, the scans rely on blood flowing through living humans, palm vein scans are virtually impossible to counterfeit.
The systems are typically contactless, which makes them more hygienic than touch-based systems.
Palm scanners are also more protective of individual privacy than some biometric technologies, such as facial recognition, because a sample cannot usually be captured without the person’s knowledge or consent.
